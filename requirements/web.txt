# Requirements of the web application

# NOTE: We use composition of requirements files (multiple -r
# parameters passed to pip) instead of including requirements files
# within others (-r lines here) because Pip has limited dependency
# resolution features (see https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/56 and
# https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/993)
